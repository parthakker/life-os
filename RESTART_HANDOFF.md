# Restart Handoff - OpenAI Migration Verification

**Date:** October 20, 2025 - 10:40 PM
**Status:** Critical bug fixed (e00eb6c), deployment complete, awaiting verification
**Action:** Use Render MCP to diagnose deployment

---

## üéØ Current Situation

### What Just Happened

**CRITICAL BUG FOUND AND FIXED:**
- Function `add_to_vector_store()` in vector_store.py was still using old torch code
- Line 246 had: `embedding_model.encode()` instead of `get_embedding()`
- This caused all "embedding_model is not defined" errors
- **FIX DEPLOYED:** Commit `e00eb6c` pushed and deployed

### Deployment Status

**Latest Commits:**
- `e00eb6c` - CRITICAL FIX: Update add_to_vector_store to use OpenAI API
- `441f0d1` - Documentation updates

**User Reports:**
- "the build went through" ‚úì
- But we need to verify logs and check for any issues

### Render MCP Available

**API Key:** rnd_7xfaiElIJY1Id0VQUYbfnvjD6TRs
**Service ID:** srv-d3r9ocbe5dus73b4vs4g
**Status:** MCP already configured in local config ‚úì

## üîç IMMEDIATE ACTIONS AFTER RESTART

### Step 1: Use Render MCP to Check Deployment

**Service ID:** `srv-d3r9ocbe5dus73b4vs4g`

**Check these items using MCP:**

1. **List recent deployments**
   - Verify commit e00eb6c is deployed
   - Check deployment status (success/failure)
   - Get deployment timestamp

2. **Query build logs**
   - Search for: "Installing openai"
   - Should see: `Installing openai>=1.55.3`
   - Should NOT see: "Installing torch" or "Installing sentence-transformers"

3. **Query application logs** (last 100 lines)
   - Look for: `[OK] Bot is running!`
   - Check for: NO "embedding_model is not defined"
   - Check for: NO "401 Unauthorized"
   - Check for: NO "Out of memory"

4. **Check metrics**
   - Memory usage (should be <200MB, not 520MB)
   - CPU usage
   - Restart count (should be stable)

5. **Verify environment variables**
   - Confirm OPENAI_API_KEY is set
   - Matches new key: sk-proj-wTr3jWgLV6ZcdyA9CYns...

## üß™ Expected Findings

### SUCCESS Scenario (Expected)

**Build logs should show:**
```
‚úì Installing openai-2.6.0 (or similar)
‚úì NO torch installation
‚úì Build completed successfully
```

**Application logs should show:**
```
[OK] Starting Life OS Telegram Bot...
[OK] Bot token: 7982716893:AAFKZ...
[OK] Bot is running!
(no errors after this)
```

**Metrics should show:**
```
Memory: ~100-150MB (down from 520MB)
CPU: Normal
Status: Running
```

### FAILURE Scenarios (Troubleshoot)

**Scenario A: Old code still deployed**
```
Symptoms: "embedding_model is not defined" still in logs
Cause: Build cache not cleared properly
Fix: Manual deploy with cache clear again
```

**Scenario B: API key still wrong**
```
Symptoms: "401 Unauthorized" in logs
Cause: API key mismatch
Fix: Verify OPENAI_API_KEY in environment matches new key
```

**Scenario C: torch still installing**
```
Symptoms: Build logs show "Installing torch"
Cause: requirements.txt not updated or git not pulled
Fix: Check git status, verify requirements.txt, force rebuild
```

## üìã Diagnostic Checklist

Use Render MCP to verify each item:

- [ ] Deployment commit is e00eb6c or later
- [ ] Build logs show `openai>=1.55.3` installing
- [ ] Build logs do NOT show torch/sentence-transformers
- [ ] Application logs show "Bot is running!"
- [ ] No "embedding_model is not defined" errors
- [ ] No "401 Unauthorized" errors
- [ ] No "Out of memory" errors
- [ ] Memory usage <200MB
- [ ] OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable set
- [ ] Service status is "Running"

---

## üéØ What to Tell User After Verification

### If ALL CHECKS PASS ‚úÖ

"Great news! The deployment is successful:
- Commit e00eb6c deployed ‚úì
- OpenAI embeddings API installed ‚úì
- Bot running without errors ‚úì
- Memory usage ~[X]MB (78% reduction!) ‚úì

**Next: Run the 4 Telegram tests to verify full functionality:**
1. `test openai migration complete` - Basic task
2. `show me my preeti tasks` - RAG search
3. `remind me to call mom tomorrow` - Auto-vectorization
4. `do I need to call anyone` - Verify search works

These tests will confirm the bug fix worked!"

### If ISSUES FOUND ‚ùå

**Document the specific issues found and provide targeted fix:**
- If wrong commit deployed ‚Üí Trigger redeploy
- If API key wrong ‚Üí Update environment variable
- If torch still installing ‚Üí Check requirements.txt and rebuild
- If memory high ‚Üí Investigate what's loading

## üîß Render MCP Commands Reference

**Service ID:** srv-d3r9ocbe5dus73b4vs4g

**Likely MCP tools available:**
- List services/deployments
- Get deployment details
- Query logs with filters
- Get service metrics
- List environment variables
- Trigger deployments

**Use these to:**
1. Verify deployment status
2. Check logs for errors
3. Confirm memory usage
4. Validate environment

## üí° Context for Diagnosis

### What We Fixed

**The Bug:**
```python
# OLD (broken) - scripts/vector_store.py:246
embedding = embedding_model.encode(embedding_text).tolist()

# NEW (fixed)
embedding = get_embedding(embedding_text)
```

**Impact:**
- Auto-vectorization of NEW tasks/notes was broken
- Existing vectorized items still searchable
- But new items couldn't be added to vector store

**Why Critical:**
- This was the LAST remaining torch reference
- All other functions already migrated
- This one was missed during initial migration

### Migration Summary

**Replaced:**
- sentence-transformers (90MB model) + torch (200MB) = 290MB
- WITH: OpenAI API calls (~10MB SDK)

**Result:**
- Memory: 520MB ‚Üí ~110MB (78% reduction)
- Cost: $7.37/mo vs $25/mo (saves $216/year)
- Quality: Better embeddings (text-embedding-3-small > all-MiniLM-L6-v2)

## üöÄ Next Steps After Verification

1. **Use Render MCP to diagnose** (do this first)
2. **Report findings to user** (success or specific issues)
3. **If successful: Guide user through 4 Telegram tests**
4. **If issues: Provide targeted fix and redeploy**
5. **Once all tests pass: Document complete success**
6. **Update session logs and close migration**

**User is waiting for diagnosis using Render MCP!**

**Render Service ID:** srv-d3r9ocbe5dus73b4vs4g
**Expected Status:** Successful deployment, bot running, ready for testing
**Confidence:** HIGH - The bug fix should resolve all issues
