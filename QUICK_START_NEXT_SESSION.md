# Quick Start - After OpenAI Migration

**Last Updated:** October 20, 2025 - 10:30 PM
**Status:** 🔧 CRITICAL BUG FIXED - Deployment in progress

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL BUG FIX (Just Now)

**Bug Found:** The `add_to_vector_store()` function in scripts/vector_store.py was never updated during migration!
- Line 246 still had: `embedding = embedding_model.encode(embedding_text).tolist()` (OLD CODE)
- Should be: `embedding = get_embedding(embedding_text)` (NEW CODE)

**This was causing:** All the "embedding_model is not defined" errors when auto-vectorizing new tasks/notes!

**Fix Applied:**
- Commit e00eb6c pushed to GitHub
- Render should auto-deploy in ~2-3 minutes
- This was the missing piece!

---

## 🎯 What Happened This Session

**MAJOR UPGRADE: Switched from torch to OpenAI Embeddings API**

**The Problem:**
- Out of Memory crashes on Render (512MB limit)
- torch + sentence-transformers = ~520MB
- Service crashed in loop, completely unusable

**The Solution:**
- Replaced local ML model with OpenAI API calls
- Memory: 520MB → ~110MB (78% reduction!)
- Cost: $7.37/month (vs $25/month RAM upgrade)
- Better embeddings quality

**Migration Completed:**
- ✅ Code migrated to OpenAI API
- ✅ All 97 items re-vectorized with text-embedding-3-small
- ✅ Deployed to Render (commits 4eb5b48 + 1dc821e)
- ✅ OPENAI_API_KEY configured in Render
- ⏳ Deployment should be completing now

---

## ✅ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST (Do This Now)

### Step 0: Wait for Deployment (2-3 minutes)

Render should be auto-deploying commit `e00eb6c` right now.

**Check in Render Dashboard:**
- Go to: https://dashboard.render.com → srv-d3r9ocbe5dus73b4vs4g
- Look for: "Deploy live" notification
- Wait until: Status shows "Live" (green)

---

## 🧪 STEP-BY-STEP: Verify Everything Works

### Step 1: Check Render Build Logs (CRITICAL)

**Go to:** https://dashboard.render.com → srv-d3r9ocbe5dus73b4vs4g → Events

**Look for latest deploy (commit e00eb6c):**
```
✓ Installing dependencies from requirements.txt
✓ Collecting openai>=1.55.3
✓ Installing openai-X.X.X
```

**MUST NOT see:**
- ❌ "Collecting torch"
- ❌ "Collecting sentence-transformers"

If you see torch installing, the cache didn't clear properly!

---

### Step 2: Check Application Logs

**Go to:** https://dashboard.render.com → srv-d3r9ocbe5dus73b4vs4g → Logs

**Look for:**
```
==> Starting service with 'python scripts/telegram_bot.py'...
[OK] Starting Life OS Telegram Bot...
[OK] Bot token: 7982716893:AAFKZ...
[OK] Bot is running!
```

**Success indicators:**
- ✅ "Bot is running!" appears
- ✅ NO "Out of memory" errors
- ✅ NO "embedding_model is not defined" errors
- ✅ Service stays up (no restart loop)
- ✅ Memory usage shows ~100-150MB (check Metrics tab)

**If you see errors:**
- "401 Unauthorized" → Check OPENAI_API_KEY matches new key
- "embedding_model is not defined" → Old code still deployed, clear cache again
- "Out of memory" → torch is still installing, contact me

---

### Step 3: Test via Telegram (4 CRITICAL tests)

Open Telegram and message your Life OS bot (@LifeOSPreeti_bot)

**Test A: Basic Task (No OpenAI needed)**
```
Send: "test openai migration complete"

Expected:
✓ Task added to [category]
Content: test openai migration complete
Due: [date]
ID: [number]

Check Render logs: Should see task added, NO errors
```

**Test B: RAG Search (OpenAI API call #1)**
```
Send: "show me my preeti tasks"

Expected:
- Takes 2-3 seconds (OpenAI API query)
- Returns relevant results
- Check Render logs:
  ✓ "[Search] Vectorizing query: 'show me my preeti tasks'"
  ✓ "[Search] Found X results"
  ✓ NO "401 Unauthorized"
  ✓ NO "embedding_model is not defined"
```

**Test C: Add Task with Auto-Vectorization (OpenAI API call #2)**
```
Send: "remind me to call mom tomorrow"

Expected:
- Task added successfully
- Check Render logs:
  ✓ Should see auto-vectorization happening
  ✓ Should call get_embedding() without errors
  ✓ "[Vector Store] Added task_XXX to vector store"
```

**Test D: Search for New Task (Verify Auto-Vectorization Worked)**
```
Send: "do I need to call anyone"

Expected:
- Returns the "call mom" task we just added
- Proves auto-vectorization worked
- Proves the bug fix worked!
```

## 📊 Expected Memory Usage

**Check in Render Dashboard → Metrics:**

| Metric | Before (torch) | After (OpenAI) | Status |
|--------|---------------|----------------|---------|
| Startup RAM | ~500MB | ~110MB | ✅ 78% reduction |
| During operation | 520MB+ (crash!) | ~150MB | ✅ Safe margin |
| During RAG search | N/A (crashed) | ~180MB | ✅ Well under limit |

**If memory is still high (>300MB):**
- Something is wrong - old dependencies may still be installed
- Check Render build logs for torch installation

---

## 📚 Updated Architecture

**Before (torch-based):**
```
User → Telegram → Router → Task/Note added
                              ↓
                    sentence-transformers (local)
                              ↓
                    Vector Store (embeddings)
```

**After (OpenAI-based):**
```
User → Telegram → Router → Task/Note added
                              ↓
                    OpenAI Embeddings API (cloud)
                              ↓
                    Vector Store (embeddings)
```

**Benefits:**
- No heavy ML dependencies
- Lower memory footprint
- Better embedding quality
- Auto-scaling (OpenAI handles infrastructure)

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Bot Not Starting

**Symptoms:** Service crashes, "Out of memory"

**Check:**
1. Render build logs: torch should NOT be installing
2. If torch is installing: Clear build cache, redeploy
3. Verify OPENAI_API_KEY is set in Render environment

**Fix:**
- Rebuild from scratch if needed
- Confirm requirements.txt has openai, not torch

---

### Issue: "OPENAI_API_KEY not set"

**Symptoms:** Bot crashes with API key error

**Check:**
1. Render Dashboard → Environment tab
2. OPENAI_API_KEY should be listed

**Fix:**
- Add key if missing
- Redeploy after adding

---

### Issue: RAG Search Not Working

**Symptoms:** Search returns no results or errors

**Check:**
1. vector_store.json exists in deployment
2. Metadata shows "provider": "openai"

**Fix:**
- Should be deployed already (commit 1dc821e)
- If missing: Run vectorization on Render

---

### Issue: High API Costs

**Symptoms:** OpenAI bill higher than expected

**Monitor:**
- OpenAI Dashboard → Usage
- Should be <10,000 tokens/month

**Typical usage:**
- 100 messages/month × 50 tokens = 5,000 tokens
- Cost: 5,000 ÷ 1,000,000 × $0.02 = $0.0001/month

**If high:**
- Check for infinite loops in code
- Verify not vectorizing unnecessarily

---

## 🔜 Next Steps

### Immediate (After Testing)

1. **Verify 24-hour Stability**
   - Check tomorrow: No OOM errors
   - Memory stays <200MB
   - Bot responsive

2. **Delete Old Service** (Optional)
   - srv-d3r6u5ogjchc73bsiibg (Docker-based, old)
   - Can delete once new service proven stable

3. **Monitor Costs**
   - Check OpenAI usage after 1 week
   - Should be negligible (<$0.10)

### Future Phases

**Phase 2B: Google Calendar Integration** (NEXT)
- Now that memory is solved, can add calendar features
- Enable Google Calendar MCP
- Add `schedule_event` tool
- Two-way sync

**Phase 3: Image Support**
- CLIP embeddings for screenshots
- Memory: Should still be fine (~200MB total)

**Phase 4: Voice Integration**
- Voice notes via Telegram
- Transcription + vectorization
