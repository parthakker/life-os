# Quick Start - After OpenAI Migration

**Last Updated:** October 20, 2025 - 9:00 PM
**Status:** 🎉 OPENAI MIGRATION COMPLETE - Ready for testing!

---

## 🎯 What Just Happened

**MAJOR UPGRADE: Switched from torch to OpenAI Embeddings API**

**The Problem:**
- Out of Memory crashes on Render (512MB limit)
- torch + sentence-transformers = ~520MB
- Service crashed in loop, completely unusable

**The Solution:**
- Replaced local ML model with OpenAI API calls
- Memory: 520MB → ~110MB (78% reduction!)
- Cost: $7.37/month (vs $25/month RAM upgrade)
- Better embeddings quality

**Migration Completed:**
- ✅ Code migrated to OpenAI API
- ✅ All 97 items re-vectorized with text-embedding-3-small
- ✅ Deployed to Render (commits 4eb5b48 + 1dc821e)
- ✅ OPENAI_API_KEY configured in Render
- ⏳ Deployment should be completing now

---

## 🧪 IMMEDIATE: Test the Deployment (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Check Render Logs

**Go to:** https://dashboard.render.com → srv-d3r9ocbe5dus73b4vs4g → Logs

**Look for:**
```
==> Starting service with 'python scripts/telegram_bot.py'...
[OK] Starting Life OS Telegram Bot...
[OK] Bot token: 7982716893:AAFKZ...
[OK] Bot is running!
```

**Success indicators:**
- ✅ "Bot is running!" appears
- ✅ NO "Out of memory" errors
- ✅ NO "[Vector Store] Loading embedding model..." (no local model!)
- ✅ Service stays up (no restart loop)

**If you see errors:**
- Check OPENAI_API_KEY is set correctly
- Check for any import errors
- Message me with error details

---

### Step 2: Test via Telegram (3 tests)

**Test A: Add a Task (No model needed)**
```
Send: "buy milk tomorrow"

Expected response:
✓ Task added to Preeti - Tasks
Content: Buy milk
Due: 2025-10-21
ID: 168
```

**Test B: Ask a Question (OpenAI API call)**
```
Send: "what are my wedding tasks"

Expected:
- Takes ~2-3 seconds (OpenAI API call)
- Returns relevant wedding tasks
- Check Render logs: Should see "[Search] Vectorizing query..."
```

**Test C: Add Another Task (Auto-vectorization)**
```
Send: "call mom next week"

Expected:
- Task added successfully
- Auto-vectorized via OpenAI API
- Immediately searchable
```

---

## 📊 Expected Memory Usage

**Check in Render Dashboard → Metrics:**

| Metric | Before (torch) | After (OpenAI) | Status |
|--------|---------------|----------------|---------|
| Startup RAM | ~500MB | ~110MB | ✅ 78% reduction |
| During operation | 520MB+ (crash!) | ~150MB | ✅ Safe margin |
| During RAG search | N/A (crashed) | ~180MB | ✅ Well under limit |

**If memory is still high (>300MB):**
- Something is wrong - old dependencies may still be installed
- Check Render build logs for torch installation

---

## 🔧 Technical Changes Summary

### What Changed

**1. Dependencies (requirements.txt):**
```diff
- sentence-transformers==3.3.1
- torch==2.5.1
+ openai>=1.55.3
```

**2. Vector Store (scripts/vector_store.py):**
- Replaced SentenceTransformer with OpenAI API
- Using text-embedding-3-small (384 dimensions)
- Simplified code (no lazy loading needed)
- Same RAG functionality, better quality

**3. Embeddings:**
- Re-vectorized all 97 items with OpenAI
- Model: text-embedding-3-small
- Provider: openai
- Dimensions: 384 (compatible with old model)

**4. Environment:**
- Added OPENAI_API_KEY to Render
- Cost: ~$0.01/month for embeddings

### What Stayed the Same

- ✅ All RAG search functionality
- ✅ Auto-vectorization on new tasks/notes
- ✅ Database schema unchanged
- ✅ Telegram bot interface unchanged
- ✅ All 41 categories intact

---

## 💰 New Cost Breakdown

**Monthly costs:**
- Render Starter: $7.00/month (512MB RAM - now sufficient!)
- Claude Haiku API: $0.36/month
- OpenAI embeddings: ~$0.01/month
- **Total: $7.37/month**

**vs Alternative (Upgrade RAM):**
- Render Standard: $25.00/month
- Claude Haiku: $0.36/month
- **Total: $25.36/month**

**Savings: $18/month = $216/year** 🎉

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**Migration is successful if:**
- ✅ "Bot is running!" in Render logs
- ✅ Memory usage <200MB
- ✅ No OOM errors for 24+ hours
- ✅ Can add tasks via Telegram
- ✅ RAG search works (returns relevant results)
- ✅ Auto-vectorization works (new items searchable)

## 📚 Updated Architecture

**Before (torch-based):**
```
User → Telegram → Router → Task/Note added
                              ↓
                    sentence-transformers (local)
                              ↓
                    Vector Store (embeddings)
```

**After (OpenAI-based):**
```
User → Telegram → Router → Task/Note added
                              ↓
                    OpenAI Embeddings API (cloud)
                              ↓
                    Vector Store (embeddings)
```

**Benefits:**
- No heavy ML dependencies
- Lower memory footprint
- Better embedding quality
- Auto-scaling (OpenAI handles infrastructure)

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Bot Not Starting

**Symptoms:** Service crashes, "Out of memory"

**Check:**
1. Render build logs: torch should NOT be installing
2. If torch is installing: Clear build cache, redeploy
3. Verify OPENAI_API_KEY is set in Render environment

**Fix:**
- Rebuild from scratch if needed
- Confirm requirements.txt has openai, not torch

---

### Issue: "OPENAI_API_KEY not set"

**Symptoms:** Bot crashes with API key error

**Check:**
1. Render Dashboard → Environment tab
2. OPENAI_API_KEY should be listed

**Fix:**
- Add key if missing
- Redeploy after adding

---

### Issue: RAG Search Not Working

**Symptoms:** Search returns no results or errors

**Check:**
1. vector_store.json exists in deployment
2. Metadata shows "provider": "openai"

**Fix:**
- Should be deployed already (commit 1dc821e)
- If missing: Run vectorization on Render

---

### Issue: High API Costs

**Symptoms:** OpenAI bill higher than expected

**Monitor:**
- OpenAI Dashboard → Usage
- Should be <10,000 tokens/month

**Typical usage:**
- 100 messages/month × 50 tokens = 5,000 tokens
- Cost: 5,000 ÷ 1,000,000 × $0.02 = $0.0001/month

**If high:**
- Check for infinite loops in code
- Verify not vectorizing unnecessarily

---

## 🔜 Next Steps

### Immediate (After Testing)

1. **Verify 24-hour Stability**
   - Check tomorrow: No OOM errors
   - Memory stays <200MB
   - Bot responsive

2. **Delete Old Service** (Optional)
   - srv-d3r6u5ogjchc73bsiibg (Docker-based, old)
   - Can delete once new service proven stable

3. **Monitor Costs**
   - Check OpenAI usage after 1 week
   - Should be negligible (<$0.10)

### Future Phases

**Phase 2B: Google Calendar Integration** (NEXT)
- Now that memory is solved, can add calendar features
- Enable Google Calendar MCP
- Add `schedule_event` tool
- Two-way sync

**Phase 3: Image Support**
- CLIP embeddings for screenshots
- Memory: Should still be fine (~200MB total)

**Phase 4: Voice Integration**
- Voice notes via Telegram
- Transcription + vectorization
