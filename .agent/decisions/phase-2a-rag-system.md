# Phase 2A: RAG System Implementation

**Date:** October 19, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Decision Summary

Implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to enable semantic search and question-answering capabilities for Life OS.

## Architecture

### Components Built

1. **Vector Store** (`scripts/vector_store.py`)
   - Custom lightweight JSON-based vector database
   - Uses `sentence-transformers` model: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
   - 384-dimensional embeddings
   - Cosine similarity for search

2. **RAG Query** (`scripts/rag_query.py`)
   - Simple formatted list output (not full Claude analysis)
   - Filters by type, category, status
   - Returns top 10 most relevant results

3. **Auto-Vectorization**
   - New tasks/notes automatically vectorized on insertion
   - Immediate searchability
   - No batch processing needed

### Why Custom Vector Store?

**Problem:** ChromaDB and LanceDB required C++ compilation on Windows
**Solution:** Built custom JSON-based store with sentence-transformers

**Benefits:**
- No compilation issues
- Portable (1.08 MB file)
- Scales to 10,000+ items
- Easy migration path to cloud vector DB later
- Works locally and in cloud deployment

## Tool Integration

Updated `router.py` to support 3 tools:
- `add_task` - Adds task + auto-vectorizes
- `add_note` - Adds note + auto-vectorizes
- `ask_question` - Queries with RAG (simple list format)

## Testing Results

✅ Auto-vectorization working
- New tasks immediately searchable
- New notes immediately searchable

✅ RAG queries working
- "what are my milk tasks" → Found new task (0.685 similarity)
- "what are my wedding tasks" → 10 results with category filter
- "what foods do i like" → Found note immediately

## Current Stats

- 95 items vectorized (93 original + 2 test items)
- Vector store size: ~1.08 MB
- Search response time: <1 second

## Future Enhancements (Phase 2B+)

- Google Calendar integration (separate `schedule_event` tool)
- Image support (CLIP embeddings)
- Migration to cloud vector DB at scale
- Two-way calendar sync
