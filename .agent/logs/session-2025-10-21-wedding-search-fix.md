# Session Summary: Wedding Search Fix - October 21, 2025

## Problem Statement

User reported that wedding-related searches were returning "No results found" despite:
- Database containing 13 wedding tasks across 7 subcategories
- Health logging and home searches working perfectly
- Task creation working (e.g., "follow up with Lukki - our wedding photographer" successfully created)

**Failed Queries:**
- "what are my wedding tasks" ‚Üí No results found
- "what are my wedding vendor tasks" ‚Üí No results found

**Working Queries:**
- "what are my house tasks" ‚Üí 10 results
- Health logging (sleep, water, exercise, InBody) ‚Üí All working

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Process

1. **Database Verification** (scripts/diagnose_production_db.py)
   - Confirmed 13 wedding tasks exist in PostgreSQL
   - Verified category hierarchy is correct
   - Found 1 duplicate category "Wedding - Wedding" (ID 50) - FIXED

2. **Vector Store Analysis** (scripts/test_wedding_search.py)
   - Built production vector store from PostgreSQL (replaced SQLite-based one)
   - Enhanced with hierarchical category names ("Wedding - Vendors" not just "Vendors")
   - Confirmed 15 wedding items with correct embeddings

3. **RAG Search Testing**
   - Direct vector search with filter `category="Wedding"` ‚Üí 10 results ‚úÖ
   - Confirmed substring matching works: "Wedding" matches "Wedding - Vendors"
   - **Conclusion:** Vector search infrastructure is WORKING

4. **AI Router Analysis**
   - Found router instructions told AI to "choose specific one" for categories with children
   - This confused AI into thinking parent categories can't be used for searches
   - **First Root Cause:** Router prompt ambiguity

5. **Category Matching Analysis**
   - Query "wedding vendor tasks" still failed after router fix
   - AI likely passed filter like "Wedding - Vendor" (singular)
   - Database has "Wedding - Vendors" (plural)
   - **Second Root Cause:** Strict substring matching can't handle formatting variations

---

## Solutions Implemented

### Solution 1: Clarify AI Router Instructions (Commit 09b89ed)

**File:** scripts/router.py:197-205, 236-239

**Changes:**
- Distinguished add vs search operations in routing prompt
- **Adding tasks/notes:** MUST use specific subcategories (e.g., "Wedding - Vendors")
- **Searching:** CAN use parent categories (e.g., "Wedding" searches all subcategories)
- Added explicit examples:
  ```
  - "what are my wedding tasks" ‚Üí filters: {"category": "Wedding"}
  - "what are my vendor tasks" ‚Üí filters: {"category": "Wedding - Vendors"}
  - "show me home tasks" ‚Üí filters: {"category": "Home"}
  ```

**Result:** "what are my wedding tasks" now returns 10 results ‚úÖ

---

### Solution 2: Flexible Category Matching (Commit be2db3c)

**File:** scripts/vector_store.py:166-218

**Added:** `category_matches(filter_category, item_category)` function

**Multi-Strategy Matching:**

1. **Strategy 1: Exact substring match (fast path)**
   - "Wedding" in "Wedding - Vendors" ‚Üí Match ‚úÖ

2. **Strategy 2: Word-level matching with:**
   - **Separator handling:** "Wedding Vendor" matches "Wedding - Vendors"
   - **Singular/plural handling:** "Vendor" matches "Vendors"
   - **Stemming-like matching:** Checks word prefixes (min 4 chars)

**Testing:** 14/14 test cases passed including edge cases:
- "Vendor" ‚Üí "Wedding - Vendors" ‚úÖ
- "Wedding Vendor" ‚Üí "Wedding - Vendors" ‚úÖ
- "Wedding - Vendor" ‚Üí "Wedding - Vendors" ‚úÖ
- "wedding vendor" ‚Üí "Wedding - Vendors" ‚úÖ (case insensitive)
- "Home" ‚Üí "Wedding - Vendors" ‚ùå (correctly rejects)

**Result:** "what are my wedding vendor tasks" now returns 4 results ‚úÖ

## Verification

### Production Testing via Telegram Bot

**Test 1: Parent Category Search**
```
User: "what are my wedding tasks"
Bot: Found 10 tasks:
  ‚è≥ [Wedding - Things Needed from Family] Finalize guest list...
  ‚è≥ [Wedding - Bachelor Party] Think of what I really want...
  ‚è≥ [Wedding - Engagement Pooja] What clothes do I want...
  (+ 7 more)
```
‚úÖ **Status:** WORKING

**Test 2: Subcategory Search with Formatting Variations**
```
User: "what are my wedding vendor tasks"
Bot: Found 4 tasks:
  ‚è≥ [Wedding - Vendors] Photobooth contract signed 10/18
  ‚è≥ [Wedding - Vendors] Reach out to Pasha - Video Contract
  ‚è≥ [Wedding - Vendors] Call Grove to confirm payment
  ‚è≥ [Wedding - Vendors] Decide invitation design asap
```
‚úÖ **Status:** WORKING

**Test 3: Leaf Category (Control Test)**
```
User: "show me home tasks"
Bot: Found 10 tasks:
  ‚è≥ [Home] Do dishes
  ‚è≥ [Home] Clean outside of house
  (+ 8 more)
```
‚úÖ **Status:** STILL WORKING (no regression)

**Test 4: Health Logging (Control Test)**
```
User: "I slept 8 hours last night"
Bot: üí§ Logged 8 hours of sleep for 2025-10-20
```
‚úÖ **Status:** STILL WORKING (no regression)

## Database Fixes Applied (Earlier in Session)

### Fix 1: Remove Duplicate Category (scripts/fix_production_categories.py)

**Problem:** Migration created "Wedding - Wedding" (ID 50) as intermediate category

**Actions:**
1. Re-parented 7 wedding subcategories from ID 50 ‚Üí ID 49 (Wedding)
2. Deleted duplicate category ID 50
3. Added 14 missing category descriptions

**Before:**
```
Wedding (ID 49)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Wedding - Wedding (ID 50) ‚ùå
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Bachelor Party
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Vendors
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (5 more)
```

**After:**
```
Wedding (ID 49)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Bachelor Party
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Vendors
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (5 more)
```

### Fix 2: Hierarchical Category Lookup (scripts/router.py:17-72)

**Enhanced:** `get_category_id()` function

**Strategies:**
1. Exact match: "Vendors" ‚Üí ID
2. Hierarchical JOIN: "Wedding - Vendors" ‚Üí JOIN parent/child
3. Child name fallback: "Vendors" (if unique)
4. Partial match: Last resort

**Also Fixed:** Changed `result[0]` to `result['id']` for dict access (was causing KeyError)

### Vector Store Structure

**Location:** vector_store.json (1161 KB)

**Metadata:**
- Model: text-embedding-3-small
- Dimensions: 384
- Total items: 97 (77 tasks + 20 notes)
- Database: PostgreSQL (production)

**Item Format:**
```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "type": "task",
  "category": "Wedding - Vendors",
  "content": "Decide invitation design asap",
  "due_date": null,
  "completed": false,
  "embedding_text": "Wedding - Vendors: Decide invitation design asap",
  "embedding": [0.123, -0.456, ...] // 384 floats
}
```

**Key Design Decision:** Include full hierarchical category in `embedding_text` to enable parent category searches.

## Commits

1. **9a07b33** - Fix production database category hierarchy and descriptions
2. **54422fc** - Enhance category lookup with hierarchical matching
3. **2b10aa4** - Build vector store from production PostgreSQL
4. **01a414b** - Add hierarchical category names to vector embeddings
5. **09b89ed** - Fix wedding task search - clarify AI routing for parent categories
6. **be2db3c** - Add flexible category matching for more user-friendly searches

---

## Performance Impact

### API Costs (Minimal)

**OpenAI Embeddings:**
- Built vector store once: 97 items √ó $0.02/1M tokens ‚âà $0.001
- Per search: 1 query embedding ‚âà $0.00001

**Anthropic AI Routing:**
- Per message: 1 Haiku call (~500 tokens) ‚âà $0.0005
- Already part of existing cost structure

### Latency (No Change)

Category matching adds ~0.1ms per item (negligible):
- Word extraction: O(n) where n = category length
- Word comparison: O(m√ón) where m = filter words, n = item words
- Typical: 2-3 words √ó 2-3 words = ~5-9 comparisons per item

**Total search time:** Still <500ms (dominated by OpenAI API call ~200ms)

---

## Why We Did This

### User Experience Improvements

**Before:**
- Rigid category matching required exact formatting
- Users had to know exact category names with dashes
- Parent categories couldn't be used for searches
- High cognitive load: "Is it 'Vendor' or 'Vendors'? Do I need the dash?"

**After:**
- Natural language category references work
- Singular/plural doesn't matter
- Parent categories search all children
- Low cognitive load: "Just ask naturally"

### Examples of User-Friendly Queries Now Working

- "what are my wedding tasks" (parent category)
- "show me vendor tasks" (singular, no parent)
- "wedding vendor tasks" (no dash separator)
- "what are my bachelor party tasks" (multi-word subcategory)
- "AI tasks" (matches "Princeton AI Partners - Hamilton Deli")

### Business Value

1. **Reduced Friction:** Users don't need to memorize category structure
2. **Increased Usage:** Easier to use = more likely to use
3. **Better AI Experience:** Feels intelligent and helpful, not rigid
4. **Scalability:** As categories grow, matching remains flexible

## Lessons Learned

### AI Routing Requires Clear Context

**Problem:** Giving AI instructions for multiple tools without context causes confusion.

**Solution:** Separate instructions by tool type:
- "When adding: do X"
- "When searching: you can also do Y"

### Substring Matching Is Too Rigid

**Problem:** Real users don't type with perfect formatting.

**Solution:** Word-level matching with fuzzy handling (plural, separators, stemming).

### Test the Full Stack, Not Just Components

**Mistake:** We tested vector search directly and it worked, but didn't test end-to-end through AI router.

**Learning:** Integration tests are crucial - components may work individually but fail together.

### Vector Embeddings Need Rich Context

**Problem:** Embedding just "Vendors: task" loses hierarchy context.

**Solution:** Include full path "Wedding - Vendors: task" so searches for "wedding" match.
