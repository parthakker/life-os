## Issues Resolved

### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: Telegram Bot Conflict Loop
- **Symptom:** 
- **Cause:** Render standard plan auto-scaled to multiple instances
- **Problem:** Telegram polling requires EXACTLY 1 instance
- **Solution:** Changed render.yaml to free plan (single instance guarantee)
- **Status:** âœ… Deployed (e02af71), waiting to verify

### Other Issues Fixed
- Production database was empty â†’ Ran base migration first
- parent_id column missing â†’ Schema migration completed
- Unicode encoding errors â†’ Replaced with ASCII
- SQLite vs PostgreSQL syntax â†’ Created separate scripts
