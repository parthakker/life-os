I'm building a Life Operating System to organize everything in my life. I'm about to give you a comprehensive brain dump transcript of everything going on - responsibilities, projects, tasks, ideas, important information, deadlines, etc.

Your job:

1. LISTEN & CATEGORIZE
   - Identify all distinct areas/categories of my life mentioned
   - Create subcategories where it makes sense
   - Organize EVERYTHING I mention into this structure

2. EXTRACT KEY DATA
   For each item, identify:
   - Category & subcategory it belongs to
   - Description
   - Any deadlines/dates mentioned
   - Any costs/amounts
   - Any actions needed (todos)
   - Priority level (if I indicate urgency)
   - Any important reference info (numbers, accounts, etc.)

3. OUTPUT FORMAT

   [SUGGESTED STRUCTURE]
   Show me a category tree with all the areas of my life you identified

   [ORGANIZED ITEMS]
   Everything I mentioned, organized into those categories with extracted data
   Format as:
   - Item | Due: [date] | Cost: [amount] | Action: [todo] | Priority: [level]

   [QUESTIONS/AMBIGUITIES]
   Anything you're unsure about or needs clarification

4. BE THOROUGH
   - Don't skip anything I mention
   - If something could go in multiple categories, note that
   - Capture ALL dates, amounts, names, important details
   - Flag items that seem time-sensitive

Ready? Here's my life dump:

## üìù Example Transcript

```
Okay so there's a lot going on. First, work stuff - I have that ID&V Rules presentation to Sendos on Monday which is huge, can't forget that. Also Fridays for Fraud with Ariana on Thursday. The DASH Migration is coming up in November so I need to start prepping for that.

Wedding planning is getting intense. We need to pay the venue five thousand dollars by October 10th, that's coming up soon. The wedding is May 3rd, 2026. It's a five-day Indian wedding - Wednesday and Thursday are the haldis and pooja, Friday is sangeet at Rasoi in South Brunswick, Saturday is welcome dinner, and Sunday is the big day at The Grove in Cedar Grove.

Buddy has been having some issues. His vet appointment is October 15th at 3pm for a checkup. I need to ask about those fat growths. Also need to remember his insurance is $275 a month to Nationwide.

Oh and I have that Uplevel Resume contract that's due in two weeks which is critical. Need to really focus on that. Also need to follow up with Hamilton Deli and Jhopri clients.

Home stuff - I really need to automate the HOA payment, keep forgetting that. Brad's rent is due soon, $1,100. And I need to schedule that dryer vent cleaning ASAP.

For friends, I should catch up with Soham soon, haven't talked in a while. And Varun and I are working on that bot project together.

Fantasy football this week - Patriots defense looking good. Might put some bets on the game.

That's about it for now I think...
