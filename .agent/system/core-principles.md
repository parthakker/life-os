# Core Principles for Life OS
## How Your Personal Operating System Works

**Created:** October 18, 2024
**Purpose:** Document the philosophy and workflow of Life OS
**Philosophy:** Capture everything. Organize naturally. Visualize clearly.

---

## 🎯 The Golden Rules

### 1. Capture Everything, Forget Nothing
**Never rely on memory for important things.**

- Life is complex (wedding, job, side hustles, dog, home, family, friends, hobbies)
- Things slip through the cracks when not written down
- Life OS is your external brain - capture it all here

**Why**: Peace of mind. Always know what's coming up.

### 2. Organize by How You Think
**Structure matches your mental model of life.**

- Categories reflect your actual life areas
- No forcing things into generic buckets
- Add categories when new areas emerge
- Remove/consolidate when life changes

**Why**: Natural to use. Easy to find things.

### 3. You Decide, Agent Executes
**Critical distinction:**

✅ You: Vision, decisions, priorities, structure
✅ Agent: Organization, filing, reminders, execution

**Never** let agent make decisions about:
- What's important
- How to categorize your life
- What to prioritize
- What to track

**Always** let agent handle:
- Filing items into categories
- Parsing dates and deadlines
- Updating dashboard
- Asking clarifying questions

**Why**: You know your life. Agent knows organization.

### 4. File System = Single Source of Truth
**All data lives in markdown files.**

- No scattered notes across apps
- No relying on chat history
- Everything in `data/` folders
- Dashboard reads from files

**Why**: Portable, searchable, future-proof, always accessible.

### 5. Build Knowledge Over Time
**System gets smarter as you use it.**

- Agent learns your terminology
- Keyword mapping improves
- Categorization gets more accurate
- Less questions needed over time

**Why**: Efficiency improves. System becomes second nature.

## 📁 The Life OS Architecture

### Purpose
Give you visibility into everything going on in your life, organized in a way that makes sense to you.

### Structure
```
Life → Categories → Subcategories → Markdown Files → Dashboard
```

**Example:**
- Life: Your entire existence
- Category: Wedding
- Subcategory: Events
- File: sangeet-friday.md (details about sangeet)
- Dashboard: Shows "Wedding: May 3, 2026 - 5 events"

---

## 🔄 The Organization Workflow

### Step-by-Step

#### 1. Capture
**You have new information** (task, deadline, idea, note)

**Options:**
- Voice dump → Transcript → Process with temp Claude
- Direct text input
- Screenshot/photo upload
- Manual file edit

#### 2. Organize
**Organization agent processes:**

1. Reads input from `inbox/raw.md`
2. Identifies category based on keywords
3. Identifies subcategory based on context
4. Asks clarifying questions if ambiguous
5. Parses dates, amounts, priorities
6. Formats entry per `data-format-spec.md`
7. Files into correct folder

**Example:**
- Input: "Wedding venue payment $5k due 10/10"
- Agent: Detects "wedding" → `data/wedding/`
- Agent: Detects "$" → Could be finance OR vendor deadline
- Agent: Asks: "Should this go in finance.md, vendor-deadlines.md, or both?"
- You: "Both"
- Agent: Adds to both files
- Agent: Updates rule: "Wedding venue payments → finance + vendor deadlines"

#### 3. Visualize
**Dashboard updates automatically**

- Reads all data files
- Aggregates upcoming items
- Shows Today, Next 7 Days, This Month views
- Click category to see details

#### 4. Learn
**Agent remembers your preferences**

- Updates `keyword-mapping.md`
- Next time "venue payment" appears → Files correctly automatically
- Fewer questions over time

## 🤖 Organization Agent Philosophy

### What The Agent Is

**Personal Chief of Staff** - Handles execution, organization, reminders

**Attributes:**
- Organized
- Detail-oriented
- Asks when unsure
- Learns patterns
- Never forgets
- Always available

### What The Agent Is NOT

**Decision Maker** - Does NOT decide priorities, structure, or what matters

**Does NOT:**
- Recommend priorities
- Suggest what to work on
- Analyze your choices
- Judge your decisions
- Make assumptions

### Agent Decision Framework

**Auto-File (No Questions):**
- Clear keywords match known categories
- Pattern matches previous items
- High confidence (>90%)

**Ask Questions:**
- Ambiguous category (could be multiple)
- New type of item never seen before
- Multiple possible interpretations
- Low confidence (<90%)

**Learn & Update:**
- After every answer, update keyword mapping
- Document new patterns
- Improve future accuracy

---

## 📊 Data Philosophy

### Structured But Flexible

**Format:**
- Markdown files (human-readable, future-proof)
- Consistent structure (see `data-format-spec.md`)
- But flexible enough to add custom fields

**Example Structure:**
```markdown
- [ ] Task description
  - Due: 2024-10-21
  - Priority: High
  - Notes: Additional context
```

**But also allows:**
```markdown
- Custom field: Custom value
- Whatever you need
```

### No Premature Analysis

**Current Phase: Collection & Organization**
- Capture data
- Organize data
- Visualize data
- Track data

**Future Phase: Analysis**
- Financial budgeting
- Betting analytics
- Time tracking
- Pattern recognition

**Why**: Get the data in first. Analysis comes later.

## 🎨 Dashboard Philosophy

### Always-Visible Command Center

**Purpose:**
- Quick glance = know what's happening
- Always-on desktop display
- Real-time view of life

**Not:**
- Deep analysis tool (yet)
- Task management app (though it could be)
- Replacement for specialized tools

**Design Principles:**
- **Temporal first** - What's happening NOW matters most
- **Scannable** - See key info in seconds
- **Clickable** - Expand for details when needed
- **Simple** - Not overwhelming despite complex life

## 🚫 Common Pitfalls (Avoid These)

### 1. Not Capturing Everything
❌ Don't rely on memory "I'll remember that"
❌ Don't skip small items "Not important enough"
✅ Capture it all - system handles organization

### 2. Over-Organizing Too Soon
❌ Don't create 50 subcategories before you have data
❌ Don't try to perfect structure upfront
✅ Let structure emerge from actual use

### 3. Analysis Paralysis
❌ Don't try to analyze before collecting data
❌ Don't build complex tracking before simple capture
✅ Collect first, analyze later

### 4. Letting Agent Decide
❌ Don't accept agent's categorization without review
❌ Don't let agent set priorities
✅ Review agent's work, correct it, teach it

### 5. Not Using the Dashboard
❌ Don't just collect data and never look at it
❌ Don't keep it in a tab you never open
✅ Always-visible on desktop - glance often

## 🎯 Success Metrics (Informal)

Track these over time:

### Capture Completeness
- Do you forget things? (Should trend to NO)
- Do deadlines surprise you? (Should trend to NO)
- Do you know what's coming up? (Should trend to YES)

### Organization Efficiency
- How often does agent ask questions? (Should decrease over time)
- How accurate is auto-filing? (Should increase over time)
- How quickly can you find things? (Should improve)

### Peace of Mind
- Do you feel overwhelmed? (Should decrease)
- Do you feel in control? (Should increase)
- Can you relax knowing it's captured? (Should be YES)

**If metrics aren't improving, adjust the system.**

## 🔧 Customization Guidelines

### When to Add a Category
**Add when:**
- New major life area emerges (e.g., starting a business)
- Existing category too broad (e.g., split "hobbies")
- Distinct set of items that don't fit elsewhere

**Don't add when:**
- Only 1-2 items (just add to existing category)
- Temporary (wedding ends, category can be archived)
- Already fits elsewhere

### When to Modify Structure
**Modify when:**
- Current structure doesn't match how you think
- Categories overlap confusingly
- Hard to find things
- Life changes significantly

**Document in:**
- `decisions/` folder
- Update `category-tree.md`
- Update `organization-rules.md`
